Every day I wake up
I pour myself a cup
Of that rich folgers aroma
The best part of waking up
It's the doo-wop doo-wop
In all I do
The moutain grown aroma
Always commin' through (always commin' through!)
Oh the best part of waking up
Is folgers in your cup

Now i'm right in harmony
With that doo-wop doo-wop di dee
WHOA, one more cup and its a who-wop shoo-bop for me
Oh, the best part of waking up
Is folgers in your cup
The best part of waking up
Is folgers in your cup
